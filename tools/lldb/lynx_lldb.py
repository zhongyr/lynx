# You don't need to do anything.

# 2. Other cases, expand the following command with full path of this file.
#    command script import {full_path_of_this_file}
#
# To globally activate the scripts, add command above to `~/.lldbinit` file,
# and create one if not exists. All subsequent LLDB processes will load these
# custom scripts when they start.
#
# You can also run the command manually in each LLDB session to only load the
# scripts in the current LLDB process.
